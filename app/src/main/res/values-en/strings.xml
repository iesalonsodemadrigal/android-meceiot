    <string name="what_is_iot">What is it?</string>
    <string name="what_is_iot_description">The Internet of Things or IoT refers to the connection of physical objects to the Internet so that they can collect data, communicate with each other and with other systems, and make decisions or activate automatic actions.</string>
    <string name="key_components">Key components of IoT</string>
    <string name="key_components_description">1. Smart devices or sensors \nCollect information from the environment: temperature, light, movement, humidity, CO₂, etc. \n2. Connectivity \nUse Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, LoRa, Zigbee, 4G/5G to send data to the cloud or other devices. \n3. Processing and analysis \nData is processed in the cloud, servers, or even on the device itself (edge computing). \n4. User interface \nUsers access information through apps, web panels, or notifications.</string>
    <string name="advantages">Advantages</string>
    <string name="advantages_description">- Task automation. \n- Energy saving. \n- Improvement of efficiency and quality of life. \n- Massive collection of useful data for decision making.</string>
    <string name="challenges">Challenges</string>
    <string name="challenges_description">- Security: many connected devices = more hacking risks. \n- Privacy: large amount of personal data. \n- Interoperability: each manufacturer may use different protocols. \n- Data management: huge volume of information (Big Data).</string>
    <string name="examples">Examples of IoT applications</string>
    <string name="examples_description">- Smart Home IoT: Lights that turn on when motion is detected, blinds that lower at sunset. \n- Smart agriculture: soil moisture sensors that activate irrigation automatically. \n- Health: bracelets that measure heart rate and send it to the doctor in real time. \n- Smart cities: garbage containers that notify when they are full. \n- Education: sensors in classrooms that measure noise, CO₂, or temperature to improve the environment.</string>
    <string name="iot_in_alonso">IoT in Alonso</string>
    <string name="iot_in_alonso_description">In our center we have four IoT panels with the following sensors: movement, light, CO2, noise, humidity and temperature.\nThey are installed in two classrooms and two hallways.\n\nThese sensors are used to analyze the data obtained and know if:\nIf there are lights on outside of school hours.\nIf a class has a high CO2 level and needs to be ventilated.\nIn case of evacuation, are there students in the classrooms.</string>
    <string name="learning_and_teaching">Learning and teaching</string>
    <string name="learning_and_teaching_description">This project allows teachers and students to apply practical knowledge about the Internet of Things through LoraWan wireless communication.\nEach year, new ideas are proposed to be used with these sensors and with the concepts of the subject or module curriculum.</string>
    <string name="meceiot_app">MeceIoT App</string>
    <string name="meceiot_app_description">In the 2024/25 academic year, the development of a mobile application that allows visualization of the data offered by the sensors has been proposed as a project to work with these sensors.\nIn addition, an alert functionality is added to display in the foreground out-of-range values provided by a sensor that require action, for example, a Co2 level that is too high.</string>
    <string name="what_is_lora">What is Lora?</string>
    <string name="what_is_lora_description">LoRa is an acronym for Long Range. It is a radio frequency modulation technology that allows wireless communication over very long distances with very low energy consumption.\nIt is not a protocol, it is just the physical layer (the way bits are transmitted over the air).\n- Range: from 2 to 15 km, depending on the environment (urban or rural).\n- Low consumption: ideal for battery-powered sensors that should last for years.\n- Secure transmission, but low speed (not suitable for video, for example).</string>
    <string name="what_is_lorawan">What is LoraWan?</string>
    <string name="what_is_lorawan_description">LoRaWAN (Long Range Wide Area Network) is the network protocol built on top of LoRa. It defines how LoRa devices communicate with a server through gateways, how messages, security, keys, authentication, and more are managed.\nImagine that:\n- LoRa = the walkie-talkie\n- LoRaWAN = the rules of the conversation (who speaks, when, how to respond…)</string>
    <string name="how_lorawan_works">How does LoraWan work?</string>
    <string name="how_lorawan_works_description">1. LoRa IoT node or sensor: Sends data (temperature, humidity, etc.) via LoRa. \n2. LoRaWAN Gateway: Receives the signal and transmits it to the internet (usually via Ethernet or 4G). \n3. LoRaWAN Network Server: Manages devices, security, message queues, etc. \n4. Application Server: Receives the useful data, displays it on dashboards, or saves it.</string>
    <string name="lora_advantages">Advantages</string>
    <string name="lora_advantages_description">- Long distance without the need for mobile networks.\n- Low consumption: devices running on batteries for years.\n- Private or public networks (The Things Network, Helium…).\n- Ideal for distributed IoT: agriculture, environment, Smart Cities…</string>
    <string name="lora_limitations">Limitations</string>
    <string name="lora_limitations_description">- Very low transmission speed (~0.3 kbps to 50 kbps).\n- Limited bandwidth and restriction on the number of messages per day.\n- Not suitable for real-time or multimedia.\n- Needs gateway or LoRaWAN coverage in the area.</string>
    <string name="lora_use_examples">Example of use</string>
    <string name="lora_use_examples_description">A humidity sensor in a vineyard sends data every 30 minutes. It uses LoRa to communicate with a gateway 5 km away. This gateway sends the data via 4G to the server in the cloud, which displays it on a dashboard for farmers.</string>
